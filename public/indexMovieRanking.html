<h1>Best Anime according to the one and only Big Diego</h1>
<h2>My top 3 Favourite Anime of all time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>3. Ranking of Kings</h3>
<p>That boy Boji yeah, born with a curse cuz his dad was a DICKHEAD and wanted more power, so young Boji is born deaf and mute and doesn't get to grow ( despite his dead beat dad being a LITERAL giant ). Boji is the best boi and I will fight anyone who says otherwise.</p>
<h4>Final Score: 10/10 babyyyyy</h4>

<h3>2. Mushoku Tensei: Jobless Reincarnation</h3>
<p>So yeah this is one is a slapper my G, animation quality for the first season is leng, and the storytelling, character and world building are top class.</p>
<h4>Final Score: 10/10 babyyyy</h4>



<h3>3. Violet Evergarden</h3>
<p>So big man ting yeah, big man like Diego doesn't really cry and that, but for this show, it was waterworks atleast 3 times PER episode. Cried so much I could barely read the subtitles. Gorgeous visuals paired with a beautiful story.</p>
<h4>Final Score: 11/10 babyyyy</h4>
